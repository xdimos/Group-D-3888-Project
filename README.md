# Math/BCMB3888-D: Yeast Models of Glioblastoma - Yin En's branch

This is Yin En's branch of the MATH3888 Group D GitHub. Each Jupyter notebook has been credited accordingly, but I will make a note of who provided the codes that I implemented. Many thanks to my mathematics colleagues for assisting me in modifying and debugging their codes - and in some cases, overhauling my sorry attempts at code and recoding something far more efficient (or something that simply works)!

```Confidence Histogram (Coloured).ipynb``` contains code to represent our confidence cut-off. This was based on Elden's protein analysis code (which can be found as ```Protein Local Processing.ipynb``` in Elden's branch), with code modifications by Freya. My only contribution, as seen in the final code, was providing credit and modifying the colours for our group portfolio (in which a variant can be found on Page 32 of the group portfolio.

```Protein Analysis ([Protein Code]).ipynb``` contains code to identify target proteins through community-finding and plotting the degree/subgraph centrality of our target proteins' communities to look for interesting outliers. This was based on Elden's protein analysis code (which can be found as ```Protein Local Processing.ipynb``` in Elden's branch), with minor modifications by myself and Elden. All codes are identical beyond the name of the target protein (and the results generated from that change), but ```Protein Analysis (YNL267W) - Final Code.ipynb``` is the cleaned version that will be of greater interest than other codes of this type.

All other code in this branch is either transferred over from the main branch (at the time of the split) or are of trivial interest.
