# Math/BCMB3888-D: Yeast models of ???

Think of this as the "front page" for our project. As it grows we should fill out this page as a reference and a record of progress.

I apologise for the terrible state of my code...

## Aim

## Glossary and other info

The homologs of WRAP53 in yeast are RSA4 "YCR072C" and TAF5 "YBR198C".

#### Proteins from Week 3 (Sunday):
TP63 - tumour protein 63<br>
associated with aggressive form of pancreatic cancer<br>
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma<br>
PDAC<br>
BUD16<br>
BUD17<br>
UBX3 <- might be very important<br>
Identifier (YDL091C)

<em>Summary</em>: in yeast, more connected proteins are more lethal when knocked out. Hence our desire to avoid knocking out essential nodes. <br><br>The degree distribution is roughly scale free Examine for our network:

Looking for things to knock out we are therefore looking for relatively low degree nodes.



## Pretty Pictures
Until we have anything else to put here, enjoy some pretty pictures :P
