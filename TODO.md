# TODO!
This is an informal document to record any mundane programming tasks that need to be done, in particular those not worthy of a proper entry in the LabArchive minutes.
Please check tasks off when you complete them, but do not delete entries.

- [x] 20/08/22 - Elden should comment his initial code better.
- [ ] 20/08/22 - The <a href="https://github.com/xdimos/Group-D-3888-Project/blob/main/Yeast_network_visualisation.ipynb">Yeast_network_visualisation.ipynb</a> should be broken into more appropriate object-oriented pieces: functions for plotting, sections for constants, etc.
- [ ] 20/08/22 - Exclusion of 'essential nodes' should be handled globally, in particular before community building? (Or not??)
